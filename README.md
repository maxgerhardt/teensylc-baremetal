Bare-Metal Teensy LC toolchain
--------------------------------

## Build with PlatformIO 

The project can be build with PlatformIO, e.g. in the VSCode PlatformIO extension or on the CLI with `pio run`. 

Refer to the general documentation at [Getting started with VSCode + PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/vscode.html#installation), [CLI reference](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/index.html) and [platformio.ini options](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/index.html).  

## Build with Makefile 

Type "make" to compile and link the sample main.cpp program.
"make burn" will load the resulting main.hex file into your
Teensy LC using the cli teensy loader.  The program
turns on your Teensy LC LED.

The makefile will compile and link all source files (.c, .S, and .cpp)
found in the working directory together into one hex file.  This hex file
is named after the TARGET variable given in the makefile.

## Example code

A sample main.c version of the main.cpp file in the repo
is given below.

```c
#include "kinetis.h"

#define LED  (1U << 5)

int main(void)
{
 SIM_SCGC5 = SIM_SCGC5_PORTC;
 PORTC_PCR5 = PORT_PCR_MUX(1U);
 GPIOC_PDDR |= LED;
 GPIOC_PSOR = LED;
 return 0;
}
```

Remember, you must ensure any port used has its clock line enabled. 
For example, with main.cpp the clock line for port c must be enabled 
in order to light the LED.  The toolchain code does not enable
any clock lines.

The ARM CMSIS library files are also provided.  See main.cpp 
to enable an example of their use.
